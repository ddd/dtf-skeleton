      <h1>Deryls Testing Framework</h1>
<h2>
  What Is DTF?
</h2>

<p>
  DTF (Deryl's Testing Framework) is designed to be a modular framework for testing everything from shell
  scripts, to Ruby, to Rails apps.  DTF acts as an umbrella skeleton which is designed to incorporate multiple
  sub-gems each of which provides additional functionality to DTF. DTF is the master skeleton within which all
  other DTF gems integrate. These additional gems conform to the naming convention: dtf-blah where 'blah' is a
  shortname for the functionality that gem provides. The 'dtf' name by itself is reserved for the Master
  Control gem alone.
</p>

<h2>
  Internal architecture
</h2>

<p>
  DTF is designed in such a way that, with the master skepeton in place, one has only to load additional
  plugins from any available DTF extension gem to add additional functionality. This can be anything ranging
  from additional languages such as Ruby, Python, C, C++, etc, to testing methods and methodologies.
